    "## Data overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Signal acquisition\n",
    "The skin conductance was recorded on the right foot using LEAD108C with EL509 electrodes with isotonic gel, and the EDA100C-MRI amplifier (DC; constant voltage at 0.5V). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing\n",
    "A bidirectional lowpass filter (cutoff: 3Hz; order:4) was applied on the raw timeserie. The signal was then downsampled at 1000Hz. The SC signal was decomposed in **phasic** and **tonic** components using the filtering method (cutoff of 0.05Hz). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Extracted features\n",
    "SCR were detected from the **phasic** SC by finding the local maxima in the signal by comparison of neighboring values (see [scipy.signal.find_peaks](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.find_peaks.html) with `default` parameters). Peaks were corrected using a minimum relative amplitude threshold. More specifically, the signal was first scaled using a max scaling approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "**SCR peaks** with an amplitude above 0.1 were kept, the other were discarded (see [neurokit2.signal.signal_findpeaks](https://neuropsychology.github.io/NeuroKit/functions/signal.html#signal-findpeaks); `relative_height_min=0.1`, `relative_max=True`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**SCR onsets** are define as the local maxima on the amplitude-inverted SC timeserie that is the closest to the previously found peaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SCR rec.t/2** or **SCR recovery** (half recovery) corresponds to the timepoint for which the SCR amplitude has declined to 50% of the SCR maximum amplitude (SCR maximum amplitude = amplitude peak - amplitude onset).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a visualization of those features, please refer to the figure under the [`eda_process` section](https://neuropsychology.github.io/NeuroKit/functions/eda.html#neurokit2.eda.eda_process) in the Neurokit2 documentation or Fig. 2.15 in [Boucsein 2012](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-1126-0) (p. 154).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features to extract for the analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "The following features will be extracted for each window. A window is defined from the onset of one stimulus to the onset of the following stimulus.This decision was made to make sure to include SCRs that could arise at the end of a given stimulus since we are using dynamic stimuli.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SCR rate**: Number of SCR in a given window / Length of the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SCR amp. max**: Maximum SCR height in a given window.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SCR amp. mean**: Mean of SCRs height in a given window.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SCR amp. sd**: Standard deviation of SCRs height in a given window."

    "## Sources of artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Artifacts** are defined as \"recorded biosignal which do not stem from the signal source in question.\" (Bousein et al., 2012).\n",
    "\n",
    "Different sources of artifacts can influence the quality of the SC timeseries. Some of those sources are described below. Our filtering steps should already have eliminated some of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MR-related artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the SC is an electrical signal, acquiring it concurrently with fMRI data introduce high frequency artifacts (see [Bottenhorn et al., 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12369973/)). However, given the low frequency of the signal of interest, our filtering procedure have mitigated some of these artifacts. However, some level of noise remains, but that should be tolerable and the threshold on the SCR detection algorithm should have not detect that noise as SCR. \n",
    "\n",
    "**How to detect**: MR-related noise should be constant throughout the run. If a SCR is detected but its shape has the same shape as the surrounding noise, it should be flagged. Or in general, if the detected SCR just doesn’t have the expected shape, it should be flagged.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to correct**: If any falsely detected SCR were identified based on the criterion above, remove the SCRs. If there is any doubt, please flag the segment and add it in the GSlide.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Power line noise\n",
    "\n",
    "Those artifacts should not be present in our preprocessed signal since we applied a lowpass filter at 3Hz (Power line at 60Hz). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "Motion can affect the quality of the signal acquired, making it unusable. Motion can also introduce non-specific SCRs (NS.SCRs). \n",
    "\n",
    "**How to detect**: motion should be fairly easy to identify. It could look like high frequency jitter, sharp spikes, vertical jumps (very steep slope). Since SCR is a relatively slow response, any sudden change / fluctuation should be flagged as noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to correct**: remove any SCRs detected in a segment containing motion artifacts. Write down the onset and duration of that segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Respiratory artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep inhalation and breath holding can introduce NS.SCRs. Deep breath can also influence the latency of SCR by \"delaying\" the onset. In our study, we could expect SCR and different breathing patterns to covary (orienting- or defensive-response). \n",
    "\n",
    "**How to correct**: it is difficult to dissociate the respiratory response from the SCR one. The only thing that we will do a posteriori is to provide the onset and duration of segments containing deep breaths. This will be retrieved automatically from the respiratory waveforms.\n",
